# notepad
simple notepad for terminal.<br/>
This is pretty easy project, written in python. It supports english only,<br/>
because it is little 'for-fun' application. I created this one to edit little files<br/>
in terminal to increase speed and not to switch between terminal and editor.

# Basics
To run editor type:***python tetibop.py***<br/>
And then you will get to the empty programm.<br>
Also you can pass file to open:***python tetibop.py***<br/>
